- Objective 1: A list containing 5 imputed datasets

- Objective 2: The original dataset of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals

- Objective 2: A list containing 5 imputed datasets

Note that for Objective 3, the data are not provided because they contain text. The data can be shared at reasonable request.


Start with running the .RProj file and then run each script (you must have the data folder in your main folder that contains the .RProj file).

As you run each script, figures and tables will be created.
